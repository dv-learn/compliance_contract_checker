Enterprise Procurement Policy

All vendor contracts must be reviewed for:
1. Auto-renewal clauses – Avoid automatic extensions beyond 12 months.
2. Termination clauses – Ensure at least 30 days' exit option.
3. SLA penalties – Clauses that ensure accountability for service downtime.
4. GDPR & compliance – All contracts involving personal data must include GDPR compliance language.

Contracts must be reviewed 90 days before renewal to evaluate vendor performance and determine continuation.
